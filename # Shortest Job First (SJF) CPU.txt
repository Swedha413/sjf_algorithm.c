# Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm
## 📘 Description
This project implements the Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm using the C programming language. 
SJF is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where the process with the smallest burst time is executed first.

## 🎯 Objective
- To understand CPU scheduling in Operating Systems
- To calculate Waiting Time and Turnaround Time
- To compare SJF with FCFS scheduling

## ⚙️ Algorithm
1. Read number of processes
2. Read burst time for each process
3. Sort processes based on burst time (ascending order)
4. Calculate waiting time
5. Calculate turnaround time
6. Display results and average times

## 🧮 Formula Used
- Waiting Time (WT) = Sum of burst times of previous processes  
- Turnaround Time (TAT) = Burst Time + Waiting Time  

## 🛠️ Language Used
- C

## 📂 Files
- `sjf.c` – Source code
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 📌 Conclusion
SJF minimizes average waiting time compared to FCFS, but it may cause starvation for longer processes.
